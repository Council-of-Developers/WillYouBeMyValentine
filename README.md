# WillYouBeMyValentine
## Overview
Welcome to WillYouBeMyValentine, a unique and fun website that brings a playful twist to the classic question, "Will you be my valentine?" The core idea is to create an interactive experience where users can express their affection by clicking "Yes," but there's a catch â€“ the "No" button will play hard to get! It constantly changes its position after every click, making it practically impossible to click.

## Features
Dynamic Button Placement: The "No" button is a moving target! After each click, it will change its position on the screen, creating a challenge for users.
Express Your Love: Users can click the "Yes" button to express their willingness to be a valentine. However, there's no escape from the love trap once they start clicking!
